## About Me

Hello there! I'm RaÃºl Mouzo. I am a computer engineering student with a true passion for cybersecurity. Throughout my academic journey, I have had the privilege of immersing myself in the fascinating realm of computer security. Through self-directed learning, I have aimed to complement my university education, aiming to enhance my skills and knowledge in this field.


## What I Love

- **Cybersecurity:** I'm embarking on a journey to educate myself in the field of cybersecurity, starting from the most common security vulnerabilities and gradually progressing to tackling more complex challenges.

- **Dedication to Linux:** I am deeply dedicated to the world of Linux, and I proudly use Kali Linux as my operating system of choice. My proficiently customized BSPWM desktop environment, coupled with an intricately designed Polybar setup, exemplifies not only my commitment to personalized computing but also my drive for efficiency in my daily tasks.

## GitHub Activity

[Linux and Pentesting Concepts](https://github.com/raulmouzo/Pentesting): A repository where I meticulously gather and document the evolving realm of Linux and pentesting. From fundamental concepts to advanced techniques, this repository serves as a comprehensive knowledge hub. Additionally, I share detailed solutions to exercises that I employ for practical practice and skill enhancement in the realm of cybersecurity and Linux.

## What I'm Learning

I believe in continuous learning, and my current focus areas include:

- Exploring cybersecurity techniques to enhance my skills in protecting systems and networks.

- Diving deeper into Linux internals, understanding kernel operations, and honing my command-line skills.
