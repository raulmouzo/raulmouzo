## Hi, I’m Raúl

Full-stack and systems engineer with experience across **frontend, backend, and infrastructure**.

I work with **JavaScript and TypeScript** in modern frontend development (**React, Tailwind**) and backend systems using **Node.js** (**NestJS**) and **Python** (**Django, FastAPI**).
I also have strong experience with **Docker, Linux, and server management**, and I enjoy exploring **cybersecurity and networking** as a hands-on technical interest.
